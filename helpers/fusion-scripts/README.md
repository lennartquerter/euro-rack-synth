# Fusion Scripts

Instead of manually creating Fusion 360 front-panels, I decided that a script would be better
to create a euro-rack panel. I can just pass in the values from the node-js script
and I could generate panels very quickly.

## Status
Still in development. I still need to figure out the hole part and feeding the information from 
KiCad.
