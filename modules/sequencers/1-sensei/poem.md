# Sequencer
(a chat-gpt generated poem about an 8-step sequencer)

In the heart of circuits, where electrons dance,<br>
Lies a realm of sound, a realm of chance.<br>
Within a Euro rack synth's labyrinthine sprawl,<br>
Resides a sequencer, the maestro of all.

Step by step, it weaves its spell,<br>
Eight notes in time, where melodies dwell.<br>
With each flicker of LED light,<br>
It guides the rhythm through the night.

A tapestry of voltage, a symphony of waves,<br>
Infinite possibilities, the sequencer paves.<br>
From basslines deep to arpeggios bright,<br>
It paints the canvas with colors of delight.

Knobs turned gently, patterns unfold,<br>
A story untold, in circuits bold.<br>
In the hands of the artist, it finds its voice,<br>
A conduit for creation, a reason to rejoice.

Through the twists and turns of cables arrayed,<br>
The sequencer's magic is displayed.<br>
In the pulsing rhythms, the melodies soar,<br>
A testament to what lies at its core.

So here's to the sequencer, the heart's true guide,<br>
In the world of synthesis, it stands beside.<br>
Eight steps it takes, but infinite the way,<br>
It shapes our sonic universe each and every day.
